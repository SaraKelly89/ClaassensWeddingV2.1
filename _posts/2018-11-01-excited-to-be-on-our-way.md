The count down is well and truly on. We get married NEXT WEEK! 

The past two years of our engagement have absolutely flown by and at long last our adventure is upon us. The RSVP's to our after party have closed. Our bags are packed (sort of) and on Sunday the 4th of November, at 4:25pm, we commence the first leg of the 36hrs travel to Reykjavik.  

I will be attempting to post stories and a few photos from our travels here as we go. Most likely written by Carl as he is the one with the gift of the gab.
