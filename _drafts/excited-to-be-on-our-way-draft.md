title: excited to be on our way (draft)
description: >-
  While some might call me obsessive, I like to think my want to personalise and
  create things exactly as I imagine them comes from a promise to myself as a
  child, that I would make my dreams a reality. I knew that a templated site
  just wasn't going to fulfill my wedding website fantasies. So when an
  opportunity came up to join a group for a 10 day learn to code retreat at the
  Institute of Code in Bali, it didn't take a lot of convincing for me to pack
  my bags and prepare for the adventure.
